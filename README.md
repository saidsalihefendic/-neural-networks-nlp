# Neural Networks with focus on NLP problems

This repository will contain Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks material with future focus on Natural Language Processing problems, where we will tackle the Generate text problem in Bosnian language and will do performance analytics.

This repository will be organized in

- Mathematics
- Machine Learning
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing

In Math, you will find the topics in math that you will stumble on during Deep Learning research, such as Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Numerical Computations.

In Machine Learning, you will find various projects and theory behind Machine Learning algorithms and Data Analysis in order to tackle Data Science problems. The idea is to give an overview of working with data and how to build predictive models and find a way to organize them using supervised and unsupervised learning, respectively. We will also look into the visualization algorithms and clustering algorithms that are commonly found in unsupervised learning solutions.

In Neural Networks, we will build a foundation on how to build Neural Networks, how to optimize for training them, what is the regularization for Deep Learning and the practical methodology behind them. We will tackle Deep Feedforward Networks and Sequence Modeling such as Recurrent and Recursive Neural Nets and see its applications on some problems. We will also view the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in order to see how we can process images.

In Natural Language Processing, here we will tackle the problem on how we define natural language on computers, what can we do with the text, how to mine text from the internet and from pictures, how to preprocess them, explaining Word2Vec model and building RNNs with the intent to build a Generate Text project for Bosnian language for various corpora of texts.

This repository will be rich in material with Machine Learning and hopefully you will find them useful, since many things will be implemented in Python and use them in the near future. I will reference the materials that made this repository possible.
